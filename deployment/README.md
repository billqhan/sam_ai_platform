# Deployment Scripts Guide

This directory contains all deployment and operational scripts for the AI-Powered RFP Response Agent.

## 🚀 Main Deployment Scripts

### Primary Deployment (Recommended)

Use the main deployment script at project root:
- **`../deploy-complete.sh`** - **MAIN DEPLOYMENT SCRIPT**
  - Complete orchestration: infrastructure + all lambdas + Java API + UI
  - Sources configuration from `.env.dev`
  - **Usage:** `./deploy-complete.sh` (full) or `./deploy-complete.sh lambda` (Lambda only)
  - **Modules:** `java-api`, `lambda`, `ui`, or omit for full deployment

### Component Deployment Scripts

- **`deploy-all-lambdas.sh`** / **`deploy-all-lambdas.ps1`** - Deploy all Lambda functions
  - Uses S3-based deployment for reliability with large packages
  - Uploads to `ai-rfp-templates-dev` bucket, then updates Lambda functions
  - Sources configuration from `../.env.dev`
  - **Usage:** `./deploy-all-lambdas.sh` (called automatically by deploy-complete.sh)
  
- **`generate-reports-and-notify.ps1`** - Run reporting workflow
  - Executes: merge logs → generate dashboard → send email
  - Can be run standalone for manual reporting

## 📊 Workflow Execution Scripts

### Full Workflow

- **`run-complete-workflow.ps1`** - Execute entire RFP pipeline
  - Downloads opportunities from SAM.gov
  - Processes and extracts individual opportunities
  - Runs AI matching against company profiles
  - Generates reports and sends notifications
  - **Usage:** `.\run-complete-workflow.ps1 -OpportunitiesToProcess 10`

- **`trigger-workflow.ps1`** - Manual workflow trigger
  - Triggers analysis workflow with Bedrock AI
  - Finds latest SAM file and initiates processing
  - **Usage:** `.\trigger-workflow.ps1 -BucketPrefix l3harris-qhan`

### Batch Operations

- **`trigger-batch-matching.ps1`** - Process opportunities in batches
  - Useful for processing large numbers of opportunities
  - Controls batch size and parallelism

## 🛠️ Utility Scripts

### Configuration Management

- **`update-sam-api-key.sh`** - Update SAM.gov API key
  - Updates API key in Lambda environment variables
  - **Usage:** `./update-sam-api-key.sh NEW_API_KEY`

- **`auto-generate-report.sh`** - Automated report generation
  - Can be scheduled via cron for automated reporting

### Monitoring & Troubleshooting

- **`check-dlq-status.ps1`** - Check Dead Letter Queue status
  - Monitors failed message processing
  - Useful for troubleshooting

- **`fix-dlq-issue.ps1`** - Fix DLQ processing issues
  - Automated remediation for common DLQ problems

## 📂 Subdirectories

### `sam-sqs-generate-match-reports/`

Contains Lambda function code and deployment scripts for the match reports generator:
- `lambda_function.py` - Main Lambda handler
- `deploy-*.ps1` - Various fix deployment scripts
- Documentation for specific fixes (citation format, imports, null safety)

## 🎯 Common Usage Patterns

### Full Clean Deploy (Recommended)
```bash
# From project root
./deploy-complete.sh
```

### Deploy Only Lambdas (Code Changes)
```bash
# From project root
./deploy-complete.sh lambda
```

### Deploy Specific Modules
```bash
# From project root
./deploy-complete.sh java-api  # Java API only
./deploy-complete.sh ui        # UI only
```

### Run Daily Processing Workflow
```powershell
cd deployment
.\run-complete-workflow.ps1 -OpportunitiesToProcess 10
```

### Generate Reports Manually
```powershell
cd deployment
.\generate-reports-and-notify.ps1
```

### Trigger Manual Workflow
```powershell
cd deployment
.\trigger-workflow.ps1
```

## 📝 Documentation Files

- **`DEPLOYMENT-SUMMARY.md`** - Detailed deployment history and notes
- **`DLQ-ISSUE-FIX-README.md`** - Documentation for DLQ troubleshooting
- **`sam-sqs-generate-match-reports/README.md`** - Match reports Lambda documentation
- **`sam-sqs-generate-match-reports/*-FIX-README.md`** - Specific fix documentation

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

All scripts require:
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- PowerShell (for workflow scripts only)
- Bash (for deployment scripts)
- Proper IAM permissions for Lambda, S3, CloudFormation, ECS operations
- Configuration file: `.env.dev` at project root (required)
- Docker (for Java API deployment)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

1. **Deployment fails:** Check CloudFormation console for detailed error messages
2. **Lambda updates fail:** Verify IAM permissions and S3 bucket `ai-rfp-templates-dev` exists
3. **Configuration errors:** Ensure `.env.dev` exists at project root with all required variables
4. **No reports generated:** Check Lambda logs in CloudWatch
5. **DLQ messages:** Use `check-dlq-status.ps1` to investigate
6. **AWS CLI hangs:** Pager disabled via `AWS_PAGER=""` in `.env.dev`

For detailed troubleshooting, see `../docs/troubleshooting/` directory.

## 📌 Notes

- Always use `../deploy-complete.sh` from project root for deployments
- All configuration is centralized in `.env.dev` - no hardcoded values
- Lambda packages are uploaded to S3 first for reliability with large files
- Monitor CloudWatch logs for Lambda execution details
- Use workflow scripts in this directory for manual testing and operations
