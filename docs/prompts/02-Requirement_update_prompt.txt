                   - filename is <solocition_id>.json

        * Errors sent to folder YYYY-MM-DD/, into subfolder for errors    



please change the processing summary, the Outputs of Runs Results to s3://sam-matching-out-runs/runs/



for Req 7,

the "sam-merge-and-archive-result-logs" Lambda function reads from  s3://sam-matching-out-runs/runs/



 Aggregrates all **Runs** into a single file in YYYYMMDDtHHMMZ.JSON FORMAT

       s3://sam-matching-out-runs/runs/YYYYMMDDtHHMMZ.JSON

       Archives old indivedual runs into archive/ folder
